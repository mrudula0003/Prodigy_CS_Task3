# 🔢Password Strength Checker
Internship Task-3 at Prodigy InfoTech

## Overview🧐
This repository contains a Python Flask application that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to users on the password's strength.

### Theoretical Explanation
#### Cybersecurity Concepts🧠
- **Password Strength**🦾: The measure of how resistant a password is to being guessed or cracked. Strong passwords are essential for protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access.
  
- ☑️**Criteria for Password Strength**:
  - **Length**: Passwords should be at least 8 characters long.
  - **Uppercase Letters**: Including uppercase letters makes passwords harder to guess.
  - **Lowercase Letters**: Including lowercase letters adds to the complexity.
  - **Numbers**: Including numbers makes passwords more difficult to crack.
  - **Special Characters**: Including special characters further increases password strength.

### 🗂️Project Structure
1. **Python Code (app.py)**: Implements the Flask web application and the password strength checker function.
2. **HTML Template (index.html)**: Provides the user interface for inputting the password and displaying feedback.

## 📌Software Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: Flask
- **IDE**: PyCharm (recommended, but any Python-compatible IDE can be used)
- **Web Browser**: For accessing the application

## 📌Hardware Requirements
- Any modern computer with at least 2GB of RAM
- Minimum of 200MB of free storage space

## Steps to Execute the Program
### 📍Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python and HTML.
- Python installed on your machine.
- Flask framework installed (`pip install Flask`).
- A text editor or Python IDE (PyCharm recommended).

### ▶️ Execution Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url> (https://github.com/mrudula0003/Prodigy_CS_Task3)
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```sh
   pip install Flask
   ```

3. **Run the Flask Application**:
   - Open `app.py` in your Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm).
   - Execute the script:
     ```sh
     python app.py
     ```
   - The application will start, and you can access it at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

### 📊 Usage
1. **Open the Application**: Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
2. **Enter Password**: Input the password you want to check and click "Check Strength".
3. **View Feedback**: The application will display feedback on the password's strength.
